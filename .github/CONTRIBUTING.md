Sorry, but please don't. This tap is really just meant to satisfy my
cantankerousness, so let me deal with it. Energy would be better spent
trying to get Homebrew Cask to properly do outdated/upgrade detection,
such as is common in modern package management, or to get Homebrew to
deal with building Go packages in a less painful way. Pull requests will
be ignored. Thanks for understanding.
