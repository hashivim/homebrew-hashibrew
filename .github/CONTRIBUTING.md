# Contributing

Pull requests will be accepted for the following reasons only:

-   to add entirely new Hashicorp products
-   to refactor, correct, or otherwise improve `autotap.py`

Pull requests that merely update versions of existing products will be
rejected. That's what `autotap.py` is for, and I'll run it as neeeded.
