# Contributing

Pull requests will be accepted for the following reasons only:

-   to add entirely new Hashicorp products
-   to refactor, correct, or otherwise improve `autotap.py`

Pull requests that merely update versions of existing products will be
rejected. That's what `autotap.py` is for, and the maintainers will run
it as needed.

Issues regarding the Hashicorp products should be directed to Hashicorp.
Issues regarding Homebrew should be directed to Homebrew. Remember, this
tap is not affiliated with or endorsed by either Hashicorp or Homebrew.
