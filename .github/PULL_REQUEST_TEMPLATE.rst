Contributing
============

Pull requests will be accepted for the following reasons only:

-  to add entirely new Hashicorp products
-  to refactor, correct, or otherwise improve ``autotap.py``

Pull requests that merely update versions of existing products will be
rejected. That's what ``autotap.py`` is for, and I'll run it as neeeded.

``autotap.py`` requires Python 3. Compatibility with Python 2 is not a
goal. Depending only on the Python 3 standard library *is* a goal.

Issues regarding the Hashicorp products should be directed to Hashicorp.
Issues regarding Homebrew should be directed to Homebrew. This tap is
not affiliated with or endorsed by either Hashicorp or Homebrew.
